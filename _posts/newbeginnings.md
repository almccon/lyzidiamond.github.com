Once upon a time, there was a girl who wasn't sure what she should do with her life. She tried a bunch of different things... and then still wasn't sure what to do. So she made a blog, and decided to start writing things down.

That girl is Lyzi Diamond, and that blog is here.

So this is the first post on that blog, and I'm sure it'll evolve over time. I hope I figure out _something_ interesting to put here, but for now, take a look at my [about]("/about.html") page, and [holler at me]("mailto:lyzidiamond@gmail.com") if you can think of something interesting for me to do.

For the moment, I'm going to go back to writing a volunteer handbook for [Code Scouts]("http://codescouts.org"), sipping coffee, and braving the cold Philadelphia weather. I look forward to hearing from you.
