  <h2>My name is Lyzi Diamond.</h2>
  <p>I live in Portland, Oregon. I'm glad you're here. <br /><br />
  	 I have lots to do and little free time. I like a lot of things &mdash; check out my <a href="/about.html">about</a> page for more. This is what I'm writing about:</p>
  	 
  <ul class="listing">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <span>{{ post.date | date: "%B %e, %Y" }}</span> <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
