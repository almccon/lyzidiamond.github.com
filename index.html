  <blockquote cite="Edwin O'Connor, The Edge of Sadness">
    <p>Night after night it's possible to see — indeed, it's impossible <strong>not</strong> to see — these faces from which hope and joy and dignity and light have been draining so steadily and for so long, that they've become nothing but this assortment of indifferent, damaged masks. They belong to human beings who, after a lifetime of struggling to become one thing or another, have succeeded only in becoming the rough sketches of their species, recognizable but empty, the bruised and wretched bodies and souls of the saddest people on earth: the people who no longer care.</p>
