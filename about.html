  <h1>Hi!</h1>

  <p><b>I'm Lyzi Diamond, I'm 24 years old, and I live in Portland, Oregon.</b> I'm glad you're here.</p>

  <p>I'm a somewhat-recent <a href="http://geography.uoregon.edu">University of Oregon Geography</a> graduate working as a GIS Technician at the <a href="http://oregongeology.org">Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI)</a>. My work at DOGAMI is primarily on FEMA flood mapping/NFIP contracts as part of its new Risk MAP spec, doing a combination of spatial analysis, Python scripting, technical writing, and cartography. I am also doing some web development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) to create a public gallery to showcase the agency's web map applications and services. In this capacity, I use both <a href="http://arcgis.com">Esri</a> tools and open source tools and libraries (<a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a>, <a href="http://mapbox.com">TileMill/MapBox</a>, and <a href="http://cartodb.com">CartoDB</a>).</p>

  <p>I spend most of the rest of my time involved with women in tech organizations, in an official capacity as the Volunteer Coordinator for <a href="http://codescouts.org">Code Scouts</a> and also as a participant in <a href="http://meetup.com/pyladies-pdx">PyLadies PDX</a>. I have also done volunteer work for <a href="http://chicktech.org">ChickTech</a>, and I have given at least <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XwUVtDedWH5ttz2Myo8dj__A-UYRgp8LnUCDJG8vLhA/edit?usp=sharing">one talk</a> about the importance of helping beginners to get excited about coding and development using <a href="http://git-scm.org">git</a> and <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>I am a member of the <a href="http://orurisa.org/ORURISAYP">Oregon URISA Young Professionals</a>, where I help organize events and run the organization's <a href="http://twitter.com/orurisayp">Twitter account</a>. I also helped to make the new <a href="http://orurisayp.org">website for the group, which is also powered on GitHub pages with Jekyll. I am also on the planning committee for the <a href="http://sunriver2013.nwgis.org">NW GIS User Group Conference</a> to take place in October in Sunriver, Oregon; for the conference, I am coordinating a scholarship for young professionals and organizing volunteers for the event.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I play in the <a href="http://www.firstunitarianportland.org/our-programs/music-arts/music-for-adults">Chalice Bells</a> handbell choir at the First Unitarian Church in Portland, I play cribbage (somewhat) competitively, I bake and decorate cakes and cupcakes, I race dragon boats, and I am generally working on at least one freelance mapping project and/or working my way through some coding tutorial. I also love college football, cooking, and riding my bicycle.</p>

  <p>I like pretty much everything.</p>
