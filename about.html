  <p>I'm Lyzi Diamond, I'm 23 years old, and I live in Portland, Oregon. I'm glad you're here.<br /><br />

  	I like a lot of different things. I currently work at the <a href="http://oregongeology.org/">Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI)</a> as a GIS Technician and for <a href="http://codescouts.org">Code Scouts</a> as their Volunteer Coordinator. I'm also on the planning committee for the <a href="http://nwgis.org">NW GIS User Group</a> 2013 Conference in Sun River, Oregon as the Scholarship and Map Gallery Coordinator, play in the <a href="http://www.firstunitarianportland.org/our-programs/music-arts/music-for-adults">Chalice Bells</a> handbell choir, and am a proud member of both <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pyladies-pdx">PyLadies PDX</a> and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/pdxpython/">Portland Python User Group</a>. <br /><br />

  	Like I said, I do a lot of things. But I want to work with you, too. Check out my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> pages, then drop me a line: <a href ="mailto:lyzidiamond@gmail.com">lyzidiamond@gmail.com</a>.</p>
